## Choose something to work on

There are [multiple repositories](https://github.com/tinkerbell) within the Tinkerbell organization.
Each repository has beginner-friendly issues that are a great place to get started on your contributor journey.
For example, a list of issues for Tink repository can be found [here](https://github.com/tinkerbell/rufio/issues).
If there is something that you find interesting and would like to work on, go ahead.
You can filter issues with label "[good first issue](https://github.com/tinkerbell/rufio/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)", which are relatively self sufficient issues and great for first time contributors.

-   If you are going to pick up an issue, it would be good to add a comment stating the intention.
-   If the contribution is a big change/new feature, please raise an issue and discuss the needs, design in the issue in detail.

## Contributing

### File an issue

Not ready to contribute code, but see something that needs work?
While the community encourages everyone to contribute code, it is also appreciated when someone reports an issue.
Issues should be filed under the appropriate Tinkerbell subrepository.
For example, a documentation issue should be opened in [tinkerbell/tinkerbell-docs](https://github.com/tinkerbell/tinkerbell-docs/issues).
Make sure to adhere to the prompted submission guidelines while opening an issue.

### Submit a change

All submissions are more than welcome.
There are [multiple repositories](https://github.com/tinkerbell) within the Tinkerbell organization.
Before you submit a change, you must fork the repository and submit a pull request with the change(s).
Please ensure that you adhere to the prompted submission guidelines while raising a pull request.
We will try to review and provide feedback as soon as possible.

### DCO Sign Off

Please read and understand the DCO found [here](docs/DCO.md).

### Environment Details

Building is handled by `make`, please see the [Makefile](Makefile) for available targets.


### Code Style Guide

#### Unit Tests

One must support their proposed changes with unit tests.
As you submit a pull request(PR) the CI generates a code coverage report.
It will help you identify parts of the code that are not yet covered in unit tests.

#### Go

##### Import Groups

There should be two groups of import blocks, one for stdlib and the other for everything else.
